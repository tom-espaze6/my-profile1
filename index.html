   <h2>Collective sports⚽🏀🏐</h2>
   <p>Collective sports helped me understood how much I wanted to become a team leader. In fact, it has shown me the importance of being someone reliable. For instance, my job was to be here for my teammates and to help them get stronger and evolve physically and mentally.  </p>

  <h2>Travel✈️</h2>
 <p> I was lucky enough to travel a lot during my childhood. I visited many different countries in Europe such as Iceland, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal and Austria. What’s more I also went to Canada, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and in South America in Peru. </p>

 <h2>Help each other❤️</h2>
 <p>Helping people in need has been a rewarding experience. As an example, three years ago, my classmates and I decided to visit an assisted living place for elderly people with a simple mission in mind: entertain them. In addition, my travel to Peru was, in reality, a special assignment. My objective was to help a school in Occopata to have access to better living conditions. To be helpful enough we organized a fundraise and we sold gloves and backpacks in France. </p>
